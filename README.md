## Protein kinase sequence alignment

The FASTA file of protein kinase sequences is given in the following file:

> kinase_domain_opisthokont.fa

This file is essentially a compilation of all kinase domain sequences found in *KinBase* for its 9 animal and fungal species. The MSA of the kinase domain sequences is represented in the following file:
